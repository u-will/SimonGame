# SimonGame:

Itâ€™s a memory game where the computer creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
It has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the computer. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
